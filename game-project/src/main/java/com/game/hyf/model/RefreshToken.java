/**
 * Represents a refresh token stored in the database.
 *
 * WHY store refresh tokens in the database?
 * -----------------------------------------
 * Access tokens (JWT) are self-contained — the server can verify them without
 * looking anything up. That is fast, but it also means you CANNOT invalidate one
 * before it expires (e.g. on logout or password change).
 *
 * Refresh tokens solve this:
 *   - They are long-lived (days/weeks) but stored in the DB, so you CAN delete them.
 *   - The client uses a refresh token to get a new short-lived access token.
 *   - On logout, you delete the refresh token → the user can never get a new access token.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   Login  →  server returns  { accessToken (15 min),  refreshToken (7 days) }
 *   Access token expires  →  client sends refreshToken  →  server returns new accessToken
 *   Logout  →  server deletes refreshToken from DB
